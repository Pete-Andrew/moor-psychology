    <h2>For Children</h2>
    <p class="forProfessionalsText">
      We know that growing up brings many changes. At times it can be both exciting and scary. There is so much to
      discover, just like the precious shells you find on the beach. At times, things that happen to us may bring up big
      feelings. These can get in the way of us doing things we used to enjoy with family and friends.
      <br><br>
      All families and children are different and we hope to get to know more about you and your family, and what matters
      most to you all.
      <br><br>
      Meeting new people can feel scary, so we have lots of fun ways of helping to learn more about your life, like using
      art, making stories and playing games together. We have helped lots of children to understand big feelings so they
      don’t get in the way of having fun.
      <br><br>
      We offer bespoke <a href="specTherLink_IntPsychotherapy.html">integrative psychotherapy</a> to children drawing on
      models including relational attachment, <a href="specTherLink_FamilyTherapy.html">family therapy,</a> cognitive and
      behavioural therapy and specialise in <a href="specTherLink_EMDR.html">EMDR therapy for children</a>.

   <h2>Testimonial</h2> 
   <p class="testimonial">
      When we met Lisa, my daughter was in a dark, frightened place. Slowly over a period of time Lisa has taught my little
      girl all the magical tools that make her life less frightening day to day. Lisa’s approach is kind and gentle, which
      instantly made my daughter feel comfortable and at ease. We gave enjoyed our appointments with Lisa as she is
      welcoming, yet so professional too.
