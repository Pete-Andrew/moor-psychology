    <h4>Dr Lisa Clive, Clinical Psychologist.</h4>
    <br>
    <p class="forProfessionalsText">
      I am an experienced supervisor with many years of experience of supervising colleagues within the NHS, higher
      education, the charity sector and private practice. I believe in the importance of offering safe and compassionate
      spaces in which the supervisees can be supported to explore their work and the impact this has on them. I am open
      to
      learning and see supervision as a space for professional and personal growth. I feel privileged to walk alongside
      others in their professional journeys. I specialise in childhood trauma, loss, bereavement and EMDR therapy with
      children and adults.

    <h1 class="seaSpray">Testimonial</h1>
    <p class="testimonial">
      I received clinical supervision from Lisa for several years, supporting my work in a community mental health
      setting.
      I found her to be an attentive listener, empathetic and thoughtful, and willing to think around issues using
      different
      perspectives. Lisaâ€™s experience in different settings shows, allowing her to support reflection and challenge
      whilst
      maintaining a compassionate response.
