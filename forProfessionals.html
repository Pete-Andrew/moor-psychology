      Dr Lisa Clive, Clinical Psychologist.
      <br>
      <p>
      I am an experienced supervisor with many years of experience of supervising colleagues within the NHS, higher
      education, the charity sector and private practice, I believe in the importance of offering safe and compassionate
      spaces in which the supervisees can be supported to explore their work and the impact this has on them. I am open to
      learning and see supervision as a space for professional and personal growth. I feel privileged to walk alongside
      others in their professional journeys. I specialise in childhood trauma, loss, bereavement and EMDR therapy with
      children and adults. .
      </p>
      
      <h2>Testimonial</h2>
      <p>
      
      
      I received clinical supervision from Lisa for several years, supporting my work in a community mental health setting.
      I found her to be an attentive listener, empathetic and thoughtful, and willing to think around issues using different
      perspectives. Lisa’s experience in different settings shows, allowing her to support reflection and challenge whilst
      maintaining a compassionate response.
      James, Plymouth
