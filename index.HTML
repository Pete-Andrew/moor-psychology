      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">     
        At Ebb and Flow Psychology we appreciate that our lives can be complex as we juggle multiple demands and the ebb and flow of our daily lives.  
        At times this can be difficult for us all and can impact on our mental health.   
        We recognise that our emotional worlds can be like the ocean tides, coming and going, 
        sometimes calm and sometimes stormy pulled by forces often not known to our conscious minds. 
        We appreciate that we may all need time to pause, reflect, process our emotions and take care of ourselves,.  
        All too often, we can neglect our own well-being and struggle to give ourselves the care and compassion we need. 
        We offer you the opportunity to slow down and explore your experiences and emotions in a safe place, free of judgment, 
        supporting you to be with the ebb and flow of the tides of your life. 
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        We recognise the importance of supporting individuals and families to process experiences and traumas which may be impacting on their relationships and lives in the present.  
        We know that trauma may show up in all shapes and sizes and can impact on our lives in varied and individual ways.  
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        At Ebb and Flow Psychology we specialise in caring for the whole family, recognising the importance of caring for parents in order to help you care for your children.  
        We understand that children and adults experience things differently and support parents to deepen their understanding of their child’s world and strengthen their relationships. 
        We believe it’s important to start early and offer support through pregnancy and to parents and their babies.   
        We know that supporting our children to face challenges and being with the emotions this brings helps strengthen families and build resilience into the future.  
        We recognise that family relationships can be challenging and support you to all to feel more connected.  
        With many years of experience supporting children and their families we can are confident in engaging children of all ages in playful and creative ways.
