    <h2>EMDR</h2>
  
    <p>
      At Ebb and Flow we specialise in offering <a href="specTherLink_AdultEMDR.html">EMDR</a> (Eye Movement Desensitisation and Representing) therapy to adults who
      have experienced trauma in their childhoods or though accidents or injuries. As a certified EMDR practitioner we have
      specialist knowledge in supporting adults to process trauma through making sense of what has happened to you and help
      you feel calmer and more empowered in your life.

    <h2>Testimonial</h2>
    <p class="testimonial">  
      Lisa was recommended to me by my previous therapist when it became clear that talking therapy alone was not
      addressing some of the deeply ingrained beliefs and coping mechanisms that I had developed since childhood. Working
      with Lisa was revolutionary for me. With a mix of talking therapy coupled with EMDR I have been able to face some
      significant life experiences that I had tried to unpick for over 20 years. After working in partnership with Lisa I
      now have a deeper understanding and acceptance of myself than I have had before. I canâ€™t recommend her highly
      enough.
