            <h2>For Children</h2>
            <p id="whatWeOfferParagraphs">We know that growing up brings many changes. At times it can be both exciting
                and scary. There is so much to discover,
                just like the precious shells you find on the beach. At times, things that happen to us may bring up big
                feelings.
                These can get in the way of us doing things we used to enjoy with family and friends.
                All families and children are different and we hope to get to know more about you and your family, and
                what matters most to you all.
                Meeting new people can feel scary, so we have lots of fun ways of helping to learn more about your life,
                like using art,
                making stories and playing games together. We have helped lots of children to understand big feelings so
                they don’t get in the way of having fun.
                We offer bespoke integrative therapy to children drawing on models including relational attachment,
                family therapy,
                cognitive and behavioural therapy and specialise in EMDR therapy for children.

                    Lisa’s approach is kind and gentle, which instantly made my daughter feel comfortable and at ease.

            <h2>For Young People</h2>
            <p> At Ebb and flow we offer young people and their families a place to explore their feelings and
                experiences.
                We recognise that growing up can feel difficult at times as young people face new experiences and
                develop their identity in a complex and changing world.
                At other times young people may have experiences that impact on their emotional well-being.
                This can feel confusing and over whelming and may be difficult to share with families and friends.
                Young people can feel alone and struggle with everyday life, such as school and relationships with
                friends and family.
                We offer bespoke integrative therapy to young people drawing on models including relational attachment,
                family therapy,
                cognitive and behavioural therapy and specialise in EMDR therapy.

        <h2>Parents</h2>
        <p>As parents we know that bringing up our children can be joyful and challenging as we support them to grow and
            develop.
            As parents we can worry about how to get it ‘right’ for our children.
            It may be hard to reach out for support for lots of reasons including fearing judgement of others or having
            had experiences of not feeling heard
            when we have raised our worries.
            Being a parent presents a rewarding, challenging and complex journey.
            This can trigger a range of feelings in our bodies and may often remind us of of our own childhood
            experiences.
            It can be all too easy to feel stuck and on your own.
            At Ebb and Flow we offer a safe place to explore your unique experiences, process any difficult experiences
            and help you feel more empowered and confident in being a “good enough” parent.
            We also offer new parents' opportunities to explore their birth experiences and join with other new parents
            and their babies in creative ways.
            This will include making early memories, building your bond with your baby and learning ways of caring for
            yourself.

        <h2>Families</h2>
        <p>
            We recognise that family life is about more than each of you as individuals. Family relationships often
            change relationships often change while children are growing up and when unexpected events happen., such as
            bereavements, young people leaving home and demanding life events. We can get stuck in familiar patterns of
            relating to each other which can make it harder to solve life problems.
            At Ebb and Flow we can offer specialist family therapy to support you in changing together.

        <h2>Adults</h2>
        <p>At Ebb and Flow we specialise in offering EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitisation and Representing) therapy to
            adults who have experienced trauma in their childhoods or though accidents or injuries. As a certified EMDR
            practitioner we have specialist knowledge in supporting adults to process trauma through making sense of
            what has happened to you and help you feel calmer and more empowered in your life.

        <h4>Testimonial</h4>

                “Lisa was recommended to me by my previous therapist when it became clear that talking therapy alone was
                not addressing some of the deeply ingrained beliefs and coping mechanisms that I had developed since
                childhood. Working with Lisa was revolutionary for me. With a mix of talking therapy coupled with EMDR I
                have been able to face some significant life experiences that I had tried to unpick for over 20 years.
                After working in partnership with Lisa I know have a deeper understanding and acceptance of myself than
                I have had before. I can’t recommend her highly enough.”
