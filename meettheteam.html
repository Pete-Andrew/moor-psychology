        I feel privileged to have walked with many children, adults and families along their therapeutic journeys since
        starting my career in Psychology over 20 years ago. I have learnt so much through my own and my clients'
        experiences and continue to learn everyday about the strengths and struggles of our daily lives and how this
        effects our psychological well- being. As a psychologist experienced in working with the NHS, education, the
        charity sector and private practice I bring a range of experience of the opportunities and challenges of working
        in different settings. I have spent much of my career specialising in working with trauma, loss and bereavement
        and feel passionate about the importance offering early support. I have experience of working with parents in
        NICU and this is one of my passions supporting parents early in their parenting journey . I know through my
        personal and professional experience what a difference having support can make, whether it’s meeting others with
        similar experiences, being part of creative therapeutic groups, offering fun family experiences or having
        therapy, what’s important to us all is knowing we are not alone and can be heard. I value thinking creatively to
        share my psychological knowledge to help deepen others understanding of the importance of supporting
        psychological well -being in children, adults and families.

        At home I enjoy being creative and love learning new crafts and being outdoors with my hands in the soil
        gardening. I love living in Devon and exploring our beautiful coastline and countryside with my family. I feel
        very drawn to the sea, hence the name of my business, Ebb and Flow, which for me beautifully portrays the
        movement in our lives, which is so powerful in our health and well-being. I also love to hold onto what is
        precious and enjoy the process of supporting others on their therapeutic journeys to seek what is precious to
        them, like the beautiful shells hidden beneath the seaweed on the beach, or the smooth piece of driftwood or
        rounded stone shaped by the tides, each with its own story, all precious and shaped by nature.
