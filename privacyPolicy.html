            <ul>
                <li>We need to collect information about you so that we know who you are and can communicate with you in a personal way. The legal basis for this is a legitimate interest.</li>
                <li>So that we can provide services to you. The legal basis for this is the contract with you.</li>
                <li>So that we can process your payment for services. The legal basis for this is the contract with you.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>What personal information do we collect and when do we collect it?</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Your name and date of birth and that of your child/young person.</li>
                <li>Your contact details including a postal address, telephone number(s) and electronic contact such as email address. We will collect this information directly from you. We may also collect information about you from third parties; for example, if you ask us to liaise with a GP or a child’s school.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>How is any information stored?</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Your personal information and any clinical notes are stored on ‘Writeupp’ which is a commercially available system specifically designed for this purpose that is GDPR compliant software, accessed through password protected computers.</li>
                <li>Only people working for Ebb and Flow Psychology can access information stored in this way.</li>
                <li>When you visit Ebb and Flow Psychology website, your information will be stored in the form of cookies. You can opt out of this from the website when the pop up appears.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>How do you use the information that is collected?</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>To communicate with you so that we can inform you about appointments.</li>
                <li>To create your invoices.</li>
                <li>To keep any clinical notes that are written to summarise therapy sessions and communications between us.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>When is information shared?</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>We agree to keep all of the information we hold about you confidential. This means that we will not normally share information about you with anyone, not even with a GP, school or other services without your consent.</li>
                <li>However, there are times when we might ethically or legally have to give information to relevant authorities. For example, if we had reason to believe that someone is at risk of harm, or to prevent a miscarriage of justice. We would usually discuss this with you first unless we believed that to do so would create further risk to you or someone else.</li>
                <li>Your details will not be sent or sold to any third-party company or organisation, as your details remain entirely confidential with Ebb and Flow Psychology</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>How long is any information kept?</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>We will keep your electronic contact details and clinical notes for 7 years for adults or up to your child’s 25th birthday as this is the minimum/maximum length of time for records to be retained and then permanently and securely erased.</li>
                <li>We keep electronic invoices for seven years as this is the required length to comply with the HMRC requirements.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>How can I see all the information you have about me?</strong>
            <p>You can make a subject access request (SAR) by contacting us. We may require additional verification that you are who you say you are to process this request. We may withhold such personal information to the extent permitted by law. In practice, this means that we may not provide information if we deem it that providing the information will violate the vital interests of someone in your family.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <strong>What if my information is incorrect on your system?</strong>
            <p>Please contact us to discuss this and request it is amended. We may require additional verification that you are who you say you are to process this request.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>How can I have my information removed from your system?</strong>
            <p>If you want to have your data removed, please contact us to discuss this request. If we determine that we need to keep the data, for example in case HMRC wish to inspect our records, we will discuss this with you. If we decide that we can delete the data, we will do so without undue delay.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Will we send emails and text messages to you?</strong>
            <p>As part of providing our service to you we will send information to you via email. Where you have consented to it, we may also use SMS (text messages). Consent for methods of communication is given by yourself by agreeing to our Terms and Conditions Agreement.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What do we expect of you regarding privacy?</strong>
            <p>When we work together, it is important that we all respect the privacy of the work. We will never record any appointment and we request the same from you. If it is found that recordings have been made without our knowledge, then any remaining work will be discontinued immediately, and Ebb and Flow Psychology reserves the right to seek legal advice regarding possible further action.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Signing Terms and Conditions / GDPR</strong>
            <p>When you sign the Terms and Conditions Agreement you are also confirming that you have seen a copy of this GDPR policy and that you consent.</p>
