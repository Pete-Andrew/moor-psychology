      <br>
      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        At Ebb and Flow Psychology we appreciate that our lives can be complex as we juggle multiple demands and the ebb
        and flow of our daily lives.
        At times this can be difficult for us all and can impact on our mental health.
        We recognise that our emotional worlds can be like the ocean tides, coming and going,
        sometimes calm and sometimes stormy pulled by forces often not known to our conscious minds.
        We appreciate that we may all need time to pause, reflect, process our emotions and take care of ourselves,.
        All too often, we can neglect our own well-being and struggle to give ourselves the care and compassion we need.
        We offer you the opportunity to slow down and explore your experiences and emotions in a safe place, free of
        judgment,
        supporting you to be with the ebb and flow of the tides of your life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        We recognise the importance of supporting individuals and families to process experiences and traumas which may
        be impacting on their relationships and lives in the present.
        We know that trauma may show up in all shapes and sizes and can impact on our lives in varied and individual
        ways.
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        At Ebb and Flow Psychology we specialise in caring for the whole family, recognising the importance of caring
        for parents in order to help you care for your children.
        We understand that children and adults experience things differently and support parents to deepen their
        understanding of their child’s world and strengthen their relationships.
        We believe it’s important to start early and offer support through pregnancy and to parents and their babies.
        We know that supporting our children to face challenges and being with the emotions this brings helps strengthen
        families and build resilience into the future.
        We recognise that family relationships can be challenging and support you to all to feel more connected.
        With many years of experience supporting children and their families we can are confident in engaging children
        of all ages in playful and creative ways.

  <h2 id="whatIsAClinicalPsychologistH2">What is a Clinical Psychologist</h2>
  <br>
  <p id="whatIsAClinicalPsychologistText">
    Clinical psychologists are trained to work with children, young people and adults experiencing difficulties in their
    emotional well-being, mental or physical health or disability. We work to help reduce psychological distress and
    promote psychological well-being. As Clinical psychologists we use our knowledge of psychological theory to help us
    understand the difficulties you and your child or family may be experiencing and work with you to help bring about
    change.
    <br><br>
  
    Clinical psychologists train for over 6 years and have an undergraduate degree as well as a post graduate doctorate in
    Clinical Psychology. At Ebb and Flow we are experienced Psychologists with many years of experience working in health,
    higher education, the charitable sector and private practice. We are registered with the Health Care Professions
    Council HCPC so you can be confident we highly trained and regulated. This is really important as anyone can call
    themselves a Psychologist, which can be confusing.
