        At Ebb and Flow Psychology we appreciate that our lives can be complex as we juggle multiple demands and the ebb
        and flow of our daily lives.
        At times this can be difficult for us all and can impact on our mental health.
        We recognise that our emotional worlds can be like the ocean tides, coming and going,
        sometimes calm and sometimes stormy pulled by forces often not known to our conscious minds.
        We appreciate that we may all need time to pause, reflect, process our emotions and take care of ourselves,.
        All too often, we can neglect our own well-being and struggle to give ourselves the care and compassion we need.
        We offer you the opportunity to slow down and explore your experiences and emotions in a safe place, free of
        judgment,
        supporting you to be with the ebb and flow of the tides of your life.

      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">

        ways.

        understanding of their child’s world and strengthen their relationships.
        We believe it’s important to start early and offer support through pregnancy and to parents and their babies.
