  <h2>Therapy for Parents</h2>

<div>
  <p class="forProfessionalsText">
    At Ebb and Flow Psychology we specialise in caring for the whole family, recognising the importance of caring for parents in order to help you care for your children. We understand that children and adults experience things differently and support parents to deepen their understanding of their child’s world and strengthen their relationships. We believe it’s important to start early and offer support through pregnancy and to parents and their babies. We know that supporting our children to face challenges and being with the emotions this brings helps strengthen families and build resilience into the future. We recognise that family relationships can be challenging and support you to all to feel more connected. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Testimonial</h2>
    <p class="testimonial">  
      Lisa's professionalism, her compassion and her authentic support following the traumatic birth of my extremely premature twins was, and is, beyond measure. Lisa gave me techniques and courage to endure the horrifying rollercoaster ride of our experience. Following the devastatingly loss of one of our beloved baby’s, I felt truly held and contained with compassion. Lisa,  with ease created a safe space for me to grieve. Lisa held hope for us when the world was the darkest it had ever been. I cannot thank or recommend Lisa enough to those who may seeking a compassionate and therapeutic space. 
    </p>


    <h2>Groups for parents</h2>
   
    <p class="forProfessionalsText">
    We are in the process of developing specialist parent groups which will include a parent baby group.  Lisa has previously worked with new parents on the Neonatal intensive care unit and has run baby groups Groups will give new parents' opportunities to explore their birth experiences and join with other parents. This will include making early memories, building your bond with your baby and learning ways of caring for yourself.
    Please get in touch if you are interested and we can let you know what groups we have coming up.
